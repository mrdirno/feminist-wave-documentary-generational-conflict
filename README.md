## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a 'complication' in their family's or community's official history. How do they investigate it, and what personal cost do they face?
- Create a found document (letter, journal entry, protest flyer, police report) that reveals a hidden conflict between two characters in a social movement.
- Write a dialogue between a 'second-wave' feminist and a 'fourth-wave' feminist where they try to find common ground, but keep talking past each other because of their unspoken generational trauma.
- Imagine a character curating a 'Wall of Worthies' for a cause they believe in. Who do they include, and more importantly, who do they consciously or unconsciously leave out? Why?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a simple web-based 'Documentary Archive' where users can click on items on a virtual corkboard (like Joan's) to reveal hidden documents, audio clips, or conflicting testimonies about a single historical event.
- Create a text-analysis script that compares the language of feminist manifestos from different decades, visualizing the shift in keywords, tone, and demanded actions.
